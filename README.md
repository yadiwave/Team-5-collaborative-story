# The Collaborative Story

It was a dark and stormy night. The rain pattered against the window, but a lone cursor blinked on a screen, ready to write the next chapter.
The little programmer and His friends came together to change world one piece of python code at a time. 
As the night goes on The SyntaxScoundrels are called to duty once again.
The while loop runs the call for the heroes to assemble until all five SyntaxScoundrels appear.
As the terminal folk call for help, the SyntaxScoundrels acknowledge the villain
An INDENTATION ERROR has appeared!
"I am the Indentation Error and I have come to bug your code!" The villain says. 
The terminal lights up, colors abound, squiggly lines and arrows guide the Scoundrels way
The Scoundrels Try to investigate the syntax lines and find the Error terrorizing the terminal city and its good people of variables. 
and they say: "There has to be a missing indent here SOMEWHERE?!""There! Its line 48, right below the function definition!""Someone activate the T.A.B. prototcol stat!"
The scoundrels finally suspect the evil villain to be a nasty logic error so the T.A.B protocol is activated and the logic error comes out hiding.
The story ends in a cliff hanger until the next episode of SyntaxScoundrels and the credits roll: 
After the scoundrels successfully defeat the indentation error, another threat emerges...The enemy isn't made of syntax but rather logic.How will they solve something larger that attacks their brains, emotions, and their sleep schedule?
